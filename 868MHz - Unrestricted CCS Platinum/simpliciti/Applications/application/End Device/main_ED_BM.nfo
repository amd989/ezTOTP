		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern unsigned char simpliciti_link() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 116 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	SMPL_Link() (1 times)
	MRFI_DelayMs() (2 times)
	SMPL_Init() (1 times)
	SMPL_Ioctl() (2 times)
	BSP_InitBoard() (1 times)

extern void simpliciti_main_sync() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 77 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	simpliciti_sync_get_data_callback() (1 times)
	simpliciti_sync_decode_ap_cmd_callback() (1 times)
	SMPL_Receive() (1 times)
	MRFI_DelayMs() (2 times)
	SMPL_SendOpt() (2 times)
	SMPL_Ioctl() (3 times)
	Timer0_A4_Delay() (1 times)

extern void simpliciti_main_tx_only() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 34 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	SMPL_SendOpt() (1 times)
	SMPL_Ioctl() (2 times)
	simpliciti_get_ed_data_callback() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	simpliciti_link()
	simpliciti_main_sync()
	simpliciti_main_tx_only()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	simpliciti_get_ed_data_callback()
	Timer0_A4_Delay()
	SMPL_SendOpt()
	SMPL_Receive()
	simpliciti_sync_decode_ap_cmd_callback()
	simpliciti_sync_get_data_callback()
	BSP_InitBoard()
	SMPL_Ioctl()
	SMPL_Init()
	MRFI_DelayMs()
	SMPL_Link()
