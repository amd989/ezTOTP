    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

static void Bsp_SetClocks() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 37 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

static void Bsp_SetVCore() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 3 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	SetVCore() (1 times)

static void SetVCore() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 27 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	SetVCoreDown() (1 times)
	SetVCoreUp() (1 times)

static void SetVCoreDown() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 24 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

static void SetVCoreUp() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 52 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>


These functions may be recursive:
	BSP_Delay()
	BSP_Init()

Function SetVCore() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[1] level == 3u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void SetVCore() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned char level :  level == 3u;

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	_disable_interrupts()
