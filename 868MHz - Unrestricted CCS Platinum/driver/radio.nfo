		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern void close_radio() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 9 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	radio_powerdown() (1 times)
	radio_reset() (1 times)

extern void open_radio() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 8 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	radio_reset() (1 times)

extern void radio_ISR() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	MRFI_RadioIsr() (1 times)
	is_rf() (1 times)

extern void radio_powerdown() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 5 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	Strobe() (2 times)

extern void radio_reset() is called from 2 sites in this file.
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	Strobe() (2 times)

extern void radio_sxoff() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 5 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	Strobe() (2 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	close_radio()
	open_radio()
	radio_ISR()
	radio_powerdown()
	radio_reset()
	radio_sxoff()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	Strobe()
	is_rf()
	MRFI_RadioIsr()
