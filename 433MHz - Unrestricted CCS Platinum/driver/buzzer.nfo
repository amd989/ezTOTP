		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern void countdown_buzzer() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 10 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	stop_buzzer() (1 times)

extern unsigned char is_buzzer() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 6 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void reset_buzzer() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 7 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void start_buzzer() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 49 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	Timer0_A3_Start() (1 times)

extern void stop_buzzer() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 15 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	reset_buzzer() (1 times)
	Timer0_A3_Stop() (1 times)

extern void toggle_buzzer() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 51 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	countdown_buzzer() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	start_buzzer()
	toggle_buzzer()
	countdown_buzzer()
	stop_buzzer()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	Timer0_A3_Stop()
	Timer0_A3_Start()
