This repo is no longer maintained. My watch has fallen into disrepair, lost in some drawer, forgotten. 

The year 2014 seems like it happened just yesterday, yet in 7 years since I worked on this, wearables advanced so much the Chronos watch reminds me of dinasaurs, and how they went extinct. It was interesting while it lasted. 

ezTOTP
------

Google 2-Step Authentication protocol on the ez430-Chronos.

Implemented using version v1.6 (21.11.2010) of Chronos software by TI.

This is a work in progress and a lot of improvements can be made. I hope it is of use to you

Usage
-----
Google has decided to use 32 byte length keys instead of 16.
If you don't have your key, go to your google account and then unlink any mobile device you have registered. 
Link it again and choose "I can't read the QR code" to see your secret key. 
After that read the QR code and input the token generated by your mobile. You should have restored back your 2-Step Authentication.
You must replace the following line with your key on the reset_totp function inside totp.c file. 

`base32_decode((const u8 *)"YOUR SECRET KEY HERE", stotp.key, 32);`

Adjusting Timezone
------------------

On the set_totp inside totp.c file there is a number you must change to adjust for your timezone.

```
stotp.code = mktime(&(stotp.time2code)) // find # seconds
					 - 2208988800 		// adj for unix epoch
					 + 21600;     		// adj for CST
					 ^^^^^^^
```

Use the following website to know which number you must enter:
http://www.epochconverter.com/epoch/timezones.php

If the number is negative, enter it positive; if its positive, enter it negative

Example:

CST = -21600  => + 21600

JST = +32400  => - 32400


I will be trying to refactor the code to be more dynamic, hopefully reading these values from some config file.

Any question, issue, comment, leave it in the issues section. I will be trying to work on this.

Texas Instruments: awesome watch!

The code is based on a Patrick Schaumont, Circuit Cellar article. I updated it with googles new key length.
