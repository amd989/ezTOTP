Making unmodified global variable CONST:
	static unsigned char sMyRxType = 0u;

Address of global variable is never taken:
	static unsigned char (*spCallback)()
	static unsigned char sMyTxType
	static const unsigned char sMyRxType
	static const struct $$fake5 *sMyAddr
	static unsigned char sTRACTID


Global variable is not modified in this file:
	static const unsigned char sMyRxType


These functions may be recursive:
	MRFI_RxCompleteISR()
	dispatchFrame()
	nwk_buildAckReqFrame()
	nwk_buildFrame()
	nwk_frameInit()
	nwk_retrieveFrame()
	nwk_sendAckReply()
	nwk_sendFrame()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	memcpy()
	memcmp()
	MRFI_Transmit()
	nwk_QfindOldest()
	nwk_getConnInfo()
	nwk_QadjustOrder()
	nwk_getMyAddress()
	MRFI_RandomByte()
	nwk_isConnectionValid()
	 ? ()
	nwk_QfindSlot()
	MRFI_Receive()

Variable's value is constant in this file:
    static const unsigned char sMyRxType = 0u;
